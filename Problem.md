1. Create a branch with the name being your roll number.
2. Create a Problem.md file which contains an item list in which an algorithm is defined for finding even
and odd numbers.
3. ``*Create a pull request and merge the request as well. (Attach screenshot)*``
4. 1. Start
2. Ask the user to input the dividend = 6
3. Ask the user to enter the divisor = 2
4. Process = dividend / divisor = 6/2 = 3
5. If the process does not get a whole number.
6. So, the dividend is not divisible by divisor.
7. If else, the process gets a whole number = 3
8. So, the dividend is divisible by divisor.
9. Process = 3/2 = 1.5
10. If the process does not get a whole number.
11. So, the result is odd number.
12. If else, the process gets a whole number
13. So, the result is the even number.
14. Print the results = ``2 is divisor of 6, result is (3) odd number``
