OBJECTIVE 2: Pseudocode   

Task 2: Take three variables as input and add them without using the + operator.  

 

Start   

  

//input/output   

 

Input number 1 = 4   

Input number 2 = 6   

Input number 3 = 8  

  

//variables and initialization   

  

Set subtraction to 0   

 

//Process steps   

  

Set subtraction to 4- (-6) -(-8)   

 

Print “18”  

 

End   

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 TASK 3: Create a small calculator which only does ‘+’ or ‘- ‘Operations. (Hint: Take three variable inputs with one being used for the operator) 

 

Start  

  

//input/output    

Input number one = 8  

Input operation = + or -   

Input number two = 9  

 

//variables and initialization   

Set sum or subtraction to 0   

  

//Conditional statement  

  

If    

Operation = `+`  

Then process   

Set sum to 8 + 9   

Print `sum = 17`  

 

If else    

Operation = `-`  

Then process   

Set sum to 8 - 9   

Print `Subtraction = -1` 

End   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

OBJECTIVE 3: Algorithm 

 

Task Three: Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+, -, *, /, %)  

 

SOLUTION:  

  

Ask the user to enter First number.   

Ask the user to enter the operation (+, -, *, /, %)  

Ask the user to enter the second number.  

If the user has entered the operation ` + `   

Process: First number + second number   

If else the user has entered the operation ` - `   

Process: First number - second number   

If else the user has entered the operation ` * `   

Process: First number * second number  

If else the user has entered the operation ` / `   

Process: First number / second number  

If else the user has entered the operation ` % `   

Process:( First number / second number) * 100  

Print the result. 

 

Task one: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well. 

 

Solution: 

 

Start  

Ask the user to input the dividend = 6  

Ask the user to enter the divisor = 2  

Process = dividend / divisor = 6/2 = 3  

If the process does not get a whole number. 

 So, the dividend is not divisible by divisor. 

If else, the process gets a whole number = 3  

So, the dividend is divisible by divisor. 

Process = 3/2 = 1.5  

If the process does not get a whole number. 

 So, the result is odd number. 

If else, the process gets a whole number  

So, the result is the even number. 

Print the results = ``2 is divisor of 6, result is (3) odd number``
